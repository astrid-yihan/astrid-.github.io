# Broccoli Static Site JSON

Simple [Broccoli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) plugin that parses collections of markdown
files and exposes them as [JSON:API](http://jsonapi.org/) documents in the output tree, under the
specified paths. It also supports the use of
[front-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/front-matter) to define meta-data for each markdown
file.

It is used for the following official Ember Documentation projects: - [Ember Guides
App](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app) - [Ember Deprecations
App](https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app)

## Basic Usage

`const jsonTree = new StaticSiteJson(folder)`

The most basic use of this Broccoli plugin is to generate a tree of JSON files from a folder filled
with markdown files. The most common usage would be to call StaticSiteJson on a `content` folder
like this: `const contentJsonTree = new StaticSiteJson('content')`.

Important nodes about default behaviour:
- The name of the folder will be the default `type` for the JSON:API document
- The type will automatically be pluralised.  So if you use the above `content` folder the type will
be `contents`
- Using front-matter you can define the `ID` or the `Title` attribute of the content. Any other
attributes must be defined in configuration.

By default the plugin also looks for a `pages.yml` that exposes it as a JSON:API document named
`pages.json` in the output path. As the name suggests, this JSON file is quite useful to build a
Table of Contents in the consuming application.

## How to integrate into an Ember app
The simplest way to integrate this into your Ember Application is to create the StaticSiteJson tree
and merge it into your Ember app tree as follows:

```javascript
'use strict';

const EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');
const BroccoliMergeTrees = require('broccoli-merge-trees');
const StaticSiteJson = require('broccoli-static-site-json');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    // Add options here
  });

  let contentsJson = StaticSiteJson('content');

  return new BroccoliMergeTrees([app.toTree(), contentsJson]);
};
```

App](https://github.com/ember-learn/guides-app)

## Detailed documentation

### Attributes
By default this plugin is assume the only attribute available on the front-matter is `title`. You
can configure what attributes you want exposed in the JSON:API output by simply adding the
`attributes` config value as follows:

```javascript
const jsonTree = new StaticSiteJson('content', {
  attributes: ['title', 'subtitle', 'index'],
});
```

### Collections
Collections is a convenient way of placing multiple markdown files (found under the same folder) in
a single JSON:API document. This can be used when wanting to retrieve multiple documents at any one
time (findAll).

```javascript
new StaticSiteJson(`content`, {
  collections: [{
    src: `content`,
    output: `allContent.json`,
  }]
})
```

* `options`
  * `src`: The folder of the markdown files intended for the same collection
  * `output`: The output file name of the collection JSON:API document.

### Relationships
One of the things that differentiates this Broccoli Plugin from some of the other approaches of
accessing Markdown from an Ember application is that because we are generating JSON:API compatible
JSON files we are able to make use of real relationships.

To define a relationship you just need to provide a `references` configuration to the StaticSiteJson
options, which works in the same way as attributes. The only difference is that front-matter value
for a reference is added to the relationships definition of the JSON:API document.

```javascript
const jsonTree = new StaticSiteJson('content', {
  references: ['author'],
});
```

### Content types

By default this plugin ouputs the Markdown in two formats: the original contents of the Markdown
file under the `content` attribute and a HTML version of the file under the attribute `html`. If you
did not need the original Markdown in production then you can remove it from the output by
specifying the content types:

```javascript
const jsonTree = new StaticSiteJson('content', {
  contentTypes: ['html'],
});
```

#### Available content types

- `content` - _default_
  - Contains the full contents of the Markdown file
- `html` - _default_
  - Contains a simple html representation of the Markdown file
- `description` - _optional_
  - Contains the first 260 characters of the content of the file
